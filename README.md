# Text Editor Starter Code

Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor
As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers. This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. You will use a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

You will deploy this full-stack application to Heroku using the Heroku Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack Blog (Links to an external site.).

This is the Progressive Web Application unit. This code:

Uses IndexedDB to create an object store and includes both GET and PUT methods, works without an internet connection, automatically saves content inside the text editor when the DOM window is unfocused, is bundled with webpack
